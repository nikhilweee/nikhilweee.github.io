Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not presenting this year (hopefully in the future), but since Baltimore is just 3 hours away from New York I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a shot. The student registration fees this year was $400, but I took advantage of the student volunteer programme which reimburses the registration fees if you agree to volunteer during the conference. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great deal to save on some costs!</description></item><item><title>House hunting in New York City</title><link>https://nikhilweee.me/blog/2022/nyc-house-hunt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nikhilweee@gmail.com (Nikhil Verma)</author><guid>https://nikhilweee.me/blog/2022/nyc-house-hunt/</guid><description>Finding a house in the most populated city in the US is no easy feat. Imagine doing that at a time when property prices are soaring, and it gets even worse. I had the pleasure of searching for a room in New York with an upper limit of $1500 at a time when the market was recovering back from super cheap COVID discounts. This post is a glimpse of what I learnt from my house hunting experience in the Summer of &amp;lsquo;22.</description></item></channel></rss>
