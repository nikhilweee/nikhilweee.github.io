It was turning out to be difficult because he was working out of Vancouver and I was studying in New York. Neither of us had visas to the other country. A week before the New Year, he calls me up. &ldquo;Bro, let&rsquo;s go to Mexico!?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>You see, Mexico doesn&rsquo;t require any additional visa if you already have a valid US or Canadian visa, so that wasn&rsquo;t going to be an issue. Me being me, without thinking too much, I answered &ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s where the fun ended. Neither of us had never been to an international vacation before. So in the two weeks before our departure, we had to plan <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Now that we&rsquo;re back from our trip, in hindsight, it feels like we managed to accomplish a lot despite our constraints. So to save you from all the trouble that we had to go through, this blog is a documentation of the logistics of our trip. Our trip was centred around two primary objectives: a <em>roadtrip</em>, because I love them; and <em>food</em>, because that&rsquo;s Shavak&rsquo;s forte.</p><div class=toc><h3>Table of Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#itinerary>Itinerary</a></li><li><a href=#planning>Planning</a><ul><li><a href=#flights>Flights</a></li><li><a href=#insurance>Insurance</a></li><li><a href=#covid-tests>COVID Tests</a></li><li><a href=#foreign-currency>Foreign Currency</a></li><li><a href=#internet>Internet</a></li><li><a href=#things-to-pack>Things to Pack</a></li><li><a href=#car-rental>Car Rental</a></li><li><a href=#accomodation>Accomodation</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-trip>The Trip</a><ul><li><a href=#day-0-cancun>Day 0: Cancun</a></li><li><a href=#day-0-valladolid>Day 0: Valladolid</a></li><li><a href=#day-1-chichen-itza>Day 1: Chichen Itza</a></li><li><a href=#day-1-cenotes-ik-kil-and-lol-ha>Day 1: Cenotes Ik-Kil and Lol-Ha</a></li><li><a href=#day-2-merida-and-progreso>Day 2: Merida and Progreso</a></li><li><a href=#day-3-bacalar>Day 3: Bacalar</a></li><li><a href=#day-4-bacalar>Day 4: Bacalar</a></li><li><a href=#day-5-tulum>Day 5: Tulum</a></li><li><a href=#day-6-tulum>Day 6: Tulum</a></li><li><a href=#day-7-playa-del-carmen>Day 7: Playa del Carmen</a></li><li><a href=#day-8-cozumel>Day 8: Cozumel</a></li><li><a href=#day-9-cancun>Day 9: Cancun</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><h1 id=itinerary>Itinerary</h1><p>Going through the interwebz, we decided to explore the Yucatan peninsula. This was the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/YGdUxtVmbUXPq1fDA>triangular route</a> that we were going to take. Starting from Cancun, we would visit the quaint little town of Valladolid, followed by the ancient ruins of Chichen Itza, before finally arriving at Merida. We would also visit the beach town of Progreso before heading over to Bacalar in the southern part of the peninsula. From there, we&rsquo;d head over to the more touristy cities of Tulum and Playa del Carmen before heading back to Cancun. During our stay in Playa, we&rsquo;d also visit the nearby island of Cozumel. Complete with beaches, ancient Mayan ruins, cenotes, lagoons, and of course, food from all over the peninsula &ndash; this journey of over a 1000 kms checked all the boxes!</p><figure><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m76!1m12!1m3!1d1918893.913315642!2d-89.09878443141888!3d20.05715704998279!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m61!3e0!4m5!1s0x8f4e8047678409bf%3A0x5fd4feaf78eabb92!2sCancun%20International%20Airport!3m2!1d21.041703299999998!2d-86.8740062!4m5!1s0x8f510ada7bbef3f7%3A0xed7a1f8fe539aa31!2sValladolid%2C%20Yucatan%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d20.68964!2d-88.20224879999999!4m5!1s0x8f5138b9a098f833%3A0xf70a67530750d45!2zQ2hpY2jDqW4tSXR6w6EsIFl1Y2F0YW4sIE1leGljbw!3m2!1d20.6791438!2d-88.5683091!4m5!1s0x8f56715cab450d17%3A0x5dfc155715abeb09!2sMerida%2C%20Yucatan%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d20.967370199999998!2d-89.5925857!4m5!1s0x8f55c2ddbdef23d3%3A0xfcf3f77278b55d2d!2sProgreso%2C%20Yucatan%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d21.281190799999997!2d-89.66516279999999!4m5!1s0x8f5bad97578b91d5%3A0x33929c6f745708e7!2sBacalar%20Lagoon%2C%20Quintana%20Roo%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d18.7671365!2d-88.30688169999999!4m5!1s0x8f4fd40310e42a4b%3A0xeedc0db93ff9ab7!2sTulum%2C%20Quintana%20Roo%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d20.2114185!2d-87.46535019999999!4m5!1s0x8f4e4323d22d4e61%3A0xe8c10b783bab4adc!2sPlaya%20del%20Carmen%2C%20Quintana%20Roo%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d20.6295586!2d-87.0738851!4m5!1s0x8f4ef8efb0d19327%3A0x342ebcae5c018bfc!2sCozumel%2C%20Quintana%20Roo%2C%20Mexico!3m2!1d20.4229839!2d-86.9223432!4m5!1s0x8f4e8047678409bf%3A0x5fd4feaf78eabb92!2sCancun%20International%20Airport!3m2!1d21.041703299999998!2d-86.8740062!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1642905304199!5m2!1sen!2sus" width=100% height=450 style=border:0 allowfullscreen loading=lazy></iframe><figcaption>The triangular route across the Yucatan</figcaption></figure><p>Here&rsquo;s a brief itinerary that you can use to book your accomodation.</p><ul><li><strong>Day 1</strong>: Arrive at Cancun, stay in Valladolid</li><li><strong>Day 2</strong>: Explore Chichen Itza, stay in Merida</li><li><strong>Day 3</strong>: Explore Progreso, stay in Merida / Progreso</li><li><strong>Day 4</strong>: Drive to, and stay in Bacalar</li><li><strong>Day 5</strong>: Explore Bacalar, stay in Tulum</li><li><strong>Day 6</strong>: Explore Coba, stay in Tulum</li><li><strong>Day 7</strong>: Visit Yal-Ku, stay in Playa del Carmen</li><li><strong>Day 8</strong>: Explore Cozumel, stay in Playa del Carmen</li><li><strong>Day 9</strong>: Explore Cancun, return back home</li></ul><h1 id=planning>Planning</h1><p>Before flying to Cancun, there were a few things we needed to take care of.</p><h2 id=flights>Flights</h2><p>This is very subjective depending on where you fly from. If you&rsquo;re taking a budget carrier, make sure to check out their baggage allowances. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, you don&rsquo;t need a mexican visa if you already have an active US or a Canadian visa. More info can be found on the ðŸŒŽ <a href="https://consulmex.sre.gob.mx/washington/index.php/servicios-para-extranjeros-visas?id=182">official website</a> of the Mexican Embassy.</p><h2 id=insurance>Insurance</h2><p>This is another decision that we leave up to you. Make sure you check the fine print, though. If your country issues a travel advisory, you might not be covered. If you&rsquo;re considering taking one, make sure COVID related situations are covered as well.</p><h2 id=covid-tests>COVID Tests</h2><p>At the time of writing, Mexico didn&rsquo;t have any additional vaccine requirements. However, the US and Canada had separate testing requirements. There are COVID testing centres easily available in Cancun and Playa del Carmen, so you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it. We got our tests done from ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/PLAYALAB?share>PlayaLab</a> right next to the pier in Playa del Carmen because of the location, reviews and prices.</p><h2 id=foreign-currency>Foreign Currency</h2><p>Credit cards are accepted in Mexico, but many places will add an additional surcharge of up to 4% per transaction. Some smaller merchants might not accept American Express, so carrying a Visa or a MasterCard is recommended. Make sure to check the foreign currency markup on your card - it&rsquo;s best if your card doesn&rsquo;t have one, or if the reward rate makes up for it.</p><p>To withdraw cash, you can either use a forex/travel card, or a debit card. Just make sure you withdraw from a bank&rsquo;s ATM, and not the ones which are privately owned. I remember seeing a charge of 50 MXN per withdrawal, so it&rsquo;s best if you keep the number of ATM visits to a minimum.</p><h2 id=internet>Internet</h2><p>You can buy a local TelCel SIM card from an Oxxo store as soon as you arrive in Mexico. Or if you&rsquo;re using T-Mobile like me, just talk to them about the Mexico and Canada add-on. For 5 USD, you can get free calls to Canada and Mexico with 4GB of high speed data. Unfortunately my phone&rsquo;s internet refused to work when I landed, and neither was I able to make any calls. Fortunately, I managed to reach T-Mobile at *233 and they resolved the issue in a timely manner.</p><h2 id=things-to-pack>Things to Pack</h2><p>Mexico was very pleasant in January when we visited. However, do check the forecast for any surprises. Apart from personal belongings, I&rsquo;d recommend keeping a <em>cenote bag</em> that you could use while diving in the water. This is basically a wet bag with some beachwear, footwear, sunscreen, sunglasses, and a towel. If you can get a snorkel or a GoPro, that would be great. We would also advise you to keep some spare US Dollars that would be handy if you run out of Mexican Pesos.</p><h2 id=car-rental>Car Rental</h2><p>We chose ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/yescarcancun?share>Yes Rent a Car</a> because of their reviews and prices. They were kind enough to offer free pick-up and drop-off services to and from Cancun Airport. If you message them on WhatsApp, you can also ask for a better price than the one quoted on their ðŸŒŽ <a href=https://yesrentacar.com.mx/english/>website</a>. An automatic sedan for 9 days cost us 522 USD. This price also included a zero deductible plan. We were happy to get a free upgrade from an Aveo to a Jetta. Overall, definitely recommended.</p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind though. <strong>One</strong>, it is mandatory to take a Third Party Insurance (TPI) in Mexico. In most cases this will already be included with your rental. <strong>Two</strong>, most car rental insurances that are bundled with US credit card are not valid in Mexico. <strong>Three</strong>, don&rsquo;t fall for insanely cheap prices. Some websites might quote unbelievable prices (like 3-4 USD per day) for the car but as soon as you go to the checkout page you&rsquo;ll see a hefty insurance charge. <strong>Four</strong>, beware of car rental scams happening around the airport. It&rsquo;s better if you book a car in advance and have someone from the rental company escort you from the airport. For these reasons, we took the all inclusive package with a zero deductible, all insurances included.</p><h2 id=accomodation>Accomodation</h2><p>We booked a budget accomodation for every city except Playa del Carmen. You could either book a regular hotel room, or a BnB. We preferred the latter. You can also consider hostels &ndash; plenty of which you can find on ðŸŒŽ <a href=https://www.hostelworld.com/>hostelworld.com</a>. Here&rsquo;s what we kept in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Valladolid</strong> is a small town, most of which is centred around the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/rziCv4Bzdri8YNcd6>Parque Principal</a>. It&rsquo;s great if you could find accomodation close to the park. That way, you can easily walk down ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/7JPapMbi1BB3XX4c9>Calzada de Los Frailes</a>, which ends in the historic ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/sSBtTJ5FyxuG6AB36>Convent of San Bernardino</a>.</li><li><strong>Merida</strong> is a large city, but we wanted to explore its historic center. So we looked for a place close to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/b4SSGS6wPtgC1u1j7>Plaza Grande</a>. We also saw a few hostels nearby, which might be worth a shot.</li><li><strong>Bacalar</strong> is a small town by the lake. Although we booked a place 18kms away from the town at the end of the lagoon, we would suggest you find a place in the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/21HYHucGefCp5cvn8>town</a> itself.</li><li><strong>Tulum</strong> has two parts: one is the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/7NP1KWt5ScddwLVv5>city centre</a>, and the other is the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/BM6EWxMKQvEoie6U9>hotel zone</a>. Most tourists stay in the hotel zone, but we avoided it because the resorts over there were prohibitively expensive. If you can find a good deal, go for it. We, however, stayed close to the city centre, which also gave us access to the local street food market.</li><li><strong>Playa del Carmen</strong>&rsquo;s touristy promenade is the Fifth Avenue, or ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/o6SKeXkUPh8XPWyy6>Quinta Avenida</a>. If you stay around this area, everything from restaurants to shopping malls will be accessible by foot. We stayed at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/hotelcolibribeach?share>Hotel Colibri Beach</a>, and the location couldn&rsquo;t have been any better.</li></ul><p>Once you are done with flight, car and hotel bookings, you&rsquo;re all set. Mexico, Â¡aquÃ­ vengo!</p><h1 id=the-trip>The Trip</h1><p>Here&rsquo;s a daily rundown of how the actual trip turned out to be. We did a lot of improvisations here and there, but at the end of the day, we were really happy with what we could achieve.</p><h2 id=day-0-cancun>Day 0: Cancun</h2><p>Arrive at Cancun, where you can use the Airport&rsquo;s Wi-Fi to contact the car representative. Get your car, and head over to the nearest Oxxo to get a SIM card if you want. For lunch, you can then head over to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/iXzmBeGiXGVgR9TM8>Ninfa&rsquo;s Cafe</a>. This cute little cafe is famous for its Oaxacan cuisine. The host, Ninfa, is very welcoming. Try their coffee if you can. It has a certain earthy flavour &ndash; Shavak loved it!</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fb6HgRM.jpg alt="Oaxacan food at ðŸ§­ Ninfa&amp;rsquo;s Cafe, Cancun"><figcaption><p>Oaxacan food at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/iXzmBeGiXGVgR9TM8>Ninfa&rsquo;s Cafe</a>, Cancun</p></figcaption></figure><p>Post lunch, drive towards Valladolid. You can either take the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/eotksjis6Mk1Q48o7>toll road</a> or the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/N5hmhzwJGRt2GWXi6>toll-free road</a>. The toll is 338 MXN for a car. We took the toll road, but I guess the other road wouldn&rsquo;t have been a bad idea either. Be aware that Valladolid lies in the state of Yucatan, which, unlike Cancun, follows the central time zone. So be prepared to save an hour during the journey. You can use this time to check-in, freshen up, and explore the local market that Valladolid has to offer.</p><h2 id=day-0-valladolid>Day 0: Valladolid</h2><p>Visit Calzada de Los Frailes, which is a street surrounded by pretty restaurants. You can try marquesitas and elotes near the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/nwqJTp4gyVcoshPB7>historic church</a>, and buy mayan alcohol on your way back. We got San Marino XtabentÃºn, which is a sweet, traditional liquor made with anise seeds and honey.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bVLXGih.jpg alt="The Valladolid sign with ðŸ§­ Convento de San Bernardino de Siena in the background."><figcaption><p>The Valladolid sign with ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/XhcLf5a3cucfHhJC6>Convento de San Bernardino de Siena</a> in the background.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For dinner, you can have traditional mayan cuisine at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/iixcatik?share>Ix Cat Ik</a>, or have tamales at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/palapitadelostamales?share>La Palapita de los Tamales</a>. This is the first place where I tried the classic chaya juice with lemon, which I absolutely fell in love with. Post dinner, you can have a taste of the alcohol that you bought, and prepare for the next day where we visit the historic Chichen Itza.</p><h2 id=day-1-chichen-itza>Day 1: Chichen Itza</h2><p>Get up early, have breakfast, and try reaching Chichen Itza before 11am &ndash; which is when tourist buses start crowding up. The entry fee is 533 MXN, which includes two types of fees &ndash; a federal fee of 400 MXN, which you can pay by card, and a state fee of 83 MXN, which you can only pay by cash. At the ticket counter, you will also have the option to hire a guide. Exploring the ancient mayan ruins takes about 2-3 hours. The main attraction is El Castillo, which is a restored step-pyramid. There&rsquo;s also a Sacred Cenote nerarby which is walk of around half a kilometre. There are a lot of vendors inside the complex selling all sorts of souvenirs, but most only accept cash.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jAuen6i.jpg alt="El Castillo at ðŸ§­ Chichen Itza"><figcaption><p>El Castillo at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/nfQJ8CmfV5qqBkhX8>Chichen Itza</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Somewhere near the exit, you can find two ATMs dispensing banknotes in US Dollars and Mexican Pesos respectively. This is also where you can buy tickets to cenote Ik-Kil for as low as 150 MXN. Try to go early, because this is also the next stop for tourist buses.</p><h2 id=day-1-cenotes-ik-kil-and-lol-ha>Day 1: Cenotes Ik-Kil and Lol-Ha</h2><p>Once you reach cenote ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/fT5njLmzvWCzjzR17>Ik-Kil</a>, park your car, get a locker, change, get a life jacket (they are mandatory), take a shower, and finally head over towards the stairway which leads to the cenote. One of the better things about the rentals at Ik-Kil is that parking, life jackets and locker fees are included in the fee. This is not the case with other cenotes. There&rsquo;s a diving pedestal inside the cenote, which is well guarded by lifeguards. Enjoy the blue waters of the cenote for as long as you want. When you&rsquo;re done, you can grab some tacos and beer at the snack bar inside the complex. There&rsquo;s also a restaurant which I believe was serving a buffet. If you like, you can try that instead.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p9XJ62t.jpg alt="People enjoying ðŸ§­ Cenote Ik-Kil"><figcaption><p>People enjoying ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/fT5njLmzvWCzjzR17>Cenote Ik-Kil</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>If you only had snacks at Ik-Kil, you can head over to the nearby town of ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/ymuEzWPGXjjLcrJX7>PistÃ©</a> to have lunch. For some reason, most restaurants here seem to have a buffet, probably to serve the package tourists that arrive here. After a bit of asking around, you can also find a restaurant which offers a-la-carte. Have lunch, and head over to the nearby town of ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/4tRNuaEqAThG37EUA>Yaxuna</a>.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ghXPm63.jpg alt="The clear, aqua-blue waters of ðŸ§­ Cenote Lol-Ha"><figcaption><p>The clear, aqua-blue waters of ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/DojG4oRCBohvJdpA6>Cenote Lol-Ha</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>This town is home to cenote ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/DojG4oRCBohvJdpA6>Lol-Ha</a>. This severely underrated cenote, known for its aqua blue water, is about 25km south of Piste. The road is mostly well made except for some abrupt topes (speed-bumps) and potholes along the way. After the bluish-green waters and touristy crowds at Ik-Kil, you will be pleasantly surprised by the aqua-blue water at Lol-Ha. The entry fee is 100 MXN, life jackets are optional. Keep in mind that there is no network around here. Once you&rsquo;re done, hop on to highway 180 towards our next stop: Merida.</p><h2 id=day-2-merida-and-progreso>Day 2: Merida and Progreso</h2><p>Check in to your accomodation, freshen up, and head to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/YURSHmVaZa972XV36>La Chaya Maya</a>. They have two branches, but I&rsquo;ve heard both serve equally good food. You can then head to the central square and treat yourselves with marquesitas before coming back home to rest for the day.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YifcN8L.jpg alt=Merida><figcaption><p>Merida</p></figcaption></figure><p>The next day, you can refuel your car at one of the PEMEX outlets. The fuel rates vary, but we found a PEMEX outlet with a rate of 19.99 MXN per litre. Surprisingly this was the best rate we could find across our roadtrip. You can then head over to the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/3AnCaeFKKvoKuscD8>Mayan World Musuem</a>, explore around a bit, and then progress towards Progreso. Have brunch at the beach restaurant ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/3iVXaQFUXdCrNVMQA>Almadia</a>, and if you feel like, you can just spend some time lazing around by the beach.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TnQnIRA.jpg alt="Salmon and Oysters at ðŸ§­ Almadia, Progreso"><figcaption><p>Salmon and Oysters at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/3iVXaQFUXdCrNVMQA>Almadia</a>, Progreso</p></figcaption></figure><p>You can then head over to the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/wxfAhVUK8VREC9yN7>Ecological Reserve of El Corcito</a> which is a mangrove swamp that is home to three cenotes. These are shallow ones, so you most likely won&rsquo;t even need a life jacket. When you&rsquo;re done, you can head over 30km towards the west to see the pink waters and the flamingos of ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/fAGhRz9c2L5MCyqW7>Laguna Rosada</a>. You would have had a long day by now. We did too, and by now we totally wished that we had decided to stay the night in Progreso.</p><p>However, we didn&rsquo;t want to take on the hassle of cancellations, and besides, we had a car &ndash; so we decided to head back to Merida. If you&rsquo;re able to make it before 6PM, try going to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/elmanjarblanco?share>Manjar Blanco</a>. If you&rsquo;re late, you can still have street food at the nearby ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/WQxsN5MZqDckLVBP6>Santa Ana Market</a>. I was craving for another Chaya Juice with Lime, so that&rsquo;s what we had along with some snacks.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ceMcPRi.jpg alt="The mangroves and cenotes of ðŸ§­ El Corcito, and Chaya Juice at ðŸ§­ Santa Ana Market"><figcaption><p>The mangroves and cenotes of ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/wxfAhVUK8VREC9yN7>El Corcito</a>, and Chaya Juice at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/WQxsN5MZqDckLVBP6>Santa Ana Market</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>For dinner, head over to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/1UJvhTuTubVEgScc9>Picheta</a>. They have rooftop dining which overlooks the ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/Wm1V9WdXJjQhmFp9A>Plaza Grande</a>. If you are lucky, you might also get to witness one of the social events at the central square. We arrived here on a Monday and a cultural programme of sorts was underway right in front of ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/g2JKsppv3hjcVrNr8>Museo Casa Montejo</a>. We were told the entry is free, however, the seats got occupied quickly. When you&rsquo;re done, get back home to finish the day with the XtabentÃºn we got earlier.</p><h2 id=day-3-bacalar>Day 3: Bacalar</h2><p>The next day, check out, and have huevos motuleÃ±os at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/ut25cKLvVYGHKq2f8>Huevos MotuleÃ±os y MÃ¡s</a>. It&rsquo;s a bit outside of the city, but the place is highly recommended for their traditional egg-based breakfast.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/r8JmiA8.jpg alt="Huevos motuleÃ±os at ðŸ§­ Huevos MotuleÃ±os y MÃ¡s"><figcaption><p>Huevos motuleÃ±os at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/ut25cKLvVYGHKq2f8>Huevos MotuleÃ±os y MÃ¡s</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Post breakfast, prepare yourselves for the longest stretch of the trip. The route of around 325 kms from Merida to Bacalar is mostly secluded, and includes a curvy section through the hills. The roads are relatively empty and you will be tempted to speed up, so make sure to keep an eye on the fuel gauge. The drive took us around 4 hours, but since Bacalar is situated in Quintana Roo, add another hour to your clock because of the time zone difference. On your way, you will encounter street vendors selling coconut water (agua de coco) and tamales. I personally really like coconut water, so you can try it out. You&rsquo;ll definitely be thirsty on your way!</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pV2A1zH.jpg alt="Enjoy prawns and the lagoon from ðŸ§­ Balneario Ejidal MÃ¡gico Bacalar"><figcaption><p>Enjoy prawns and the lagoon from ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/CbgX19SJ7ir2FEHf6>Balneario Ejidal MÃ¡gico Bacalar</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Upon arriving in Bacalar, have seafood for lunch at ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/CbgX19SJ7ir2FEHf6>Balneario Ejidal MÃ¡gico Bacalar</a>. Their quantity of food is generous, so consider that before ordering. We ordered grilled prawns and aguachile, which were amazing. The entry is 30 MXN, which includes parking. You can even take a dip in the lagoon if you want. If the weather is sunny, try and get a boat ride across the lagoon. We arrived here a bit too late on a Tuesday, and it was cloudy, so we couldn&rsquo;t find enough people for the &ldquo;colectivo&rdquo; boat ride, which costs around 300 MXN per person.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IdH27TW.jpg alt="ðŸ§­ La Playita, on the banks of the lagoon at Bacalar"><figcaption><p>ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/laplayitabacalar?share>La Playita</a>, on the banks of the lagoon at Bacalar</p></figcaption></figure><p>In the evening, you can explore the local market, buy some souvenirs, and head over to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://g.page/laplayitabacalar?share>La Playita</a> for dinner. This is situated right next to Balneario Ejidal, the place we suggested for lunch. Surprisingly, over here, beer is cheaper than water. However, all that aside, the vibe of this place was the best amongst all the places we visited on our trip. Try to find a seat by the lagoon if you can. It&rsquo;s really beautiful. Spend some time here before heading back home to relax.</p><h2 id=day-4-bacalar>Day 4: Bacalar</h2><p>The next morning, arrange for a kayak and enjoy the serenity as you watch the sunrise from the lagoon. Have some breakfast at the hotel, and head to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/9NecUuJ4ud35R8Uh7>Los Rapidos</a>. It&rsquo;s a narrow stretch of shallow water where you can float around in the clear blue water of the lagoon. We have to warn you that we did see a lot of tourists over here. The entry is reasonable, and life jackets are included in the price. Enjoy your time around the hammocks. When you&rsquo;re hungry, head over to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/rxfdnc8uNDhRrEx86>El ManatÃ­</a> for breakfast. You can try another variation of <em>huevos</em>, or you&rsquo;re in for some western options, can also try the sandwich variants. When done, head over to our next stop: Tulum.</p><h2 id=day-5-tulum>Day 5: Tulum</h2><p>Tulum is divided into two regions &ndash; the <em>zona hotelera</em> or the hotel zone, which is a stip of hotels and resorts by the beach, and <em>pueblo</em> or the city, which is the centre of Tulum. The hotel zone was too crowded for us, so we decided to stay in the city. Keep in mind that for this reason, we didn&rsquo;t go to the hotel zone during our stay at Tulum. You can chec this out yourself if you pass through the hotel zone on your way to the accomodation. Check in, and head out to explore Tulum.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PPKwKXv.jpg alt="Some mezcals or what? ðŸ§­ Los Morros, Tulum"><figcaption><p><em>Some mezcals or what?</em> ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/fLkkAwabFuNpHcUZA>Los Morros</a>, Tulum</p></figcaption></figure><p>You should be hungry by now, so head over to ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/fLkkAwabFuNpHcUZA>Los Morros</a>. Right above the bar, you&rsquo;ll be greeted with the words &ldquo;<em>unos mezcales o que?</em>&rdquo; (spanish for &ldquo;some mezcals or what?&rdquo;). How can you resist yourself from having some cocktails over here? If in doubt, order a Mezcalina. We loved it! Moving on, you can head over to the main street (Highway 307) and buy some (more) souvenirs. The farther you get from the city centre, the cheaper the prices. Make sure to check out the street food which is right behind ðŸ§­ <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/v2vy4n7tLy5LTXSF7>Parque Dos Aguas</a>. The churros and marquesitas we had here were the best in our entire trip.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2kk4xBj.jpg alt=Tulum><figcaption><p>Tulum</p></figcaption></figure><p>If you stay in the city centre (pueblo) and want to explore the nightlife, you have limited options. You can go to <strong>Batey</strong> which is famous for using sugarcane juice. The vibe was also good here, although it was a bit crowded.</p><p>You can also head over to this japanese fusion place, which is a bit expensive but their mezcalitas are pretty strong. Finally, head over to <strong>Santiago</strong> if you are in a mood to dance.</p><p>If you have midnight hunger pangs, some to the area next to the pemex station. The guy sells one of the best tacos we had. You should be tired now, so get some rest.</p><h2 id=day-6-tulum>Day 6: Tulum</h2><p>The next day, have a lazy morning, and head over to Coba. Keep in mind that you can no longer climb the pyramid over here. On your way back, take a swim in the gran cenote or cenote cavalera. We couldn&rsquo;t go to gran cenote since we were late, but cavalera had a swing and it also had pits from which you can jump into the ground, which is pretty cool. After you&rsquo;re done, head back home and you can then head over to <strong>some local place</strong> followed by Horus to enjoy some hookah. After you&rsquo;re done, head back home to get some rest.</p><h2 id=day-7-playa-del-carmen>Day 7: Playa del Carmen</h2><p>Head over to this lagoon and enjoy snorkelling. We spent quite some time over here. The flow is towards the ocean so keep in mind that going towards the ocean is easier, returning back is hard. Apart from the entry fee, make sure you get the diving set complete with fins, visors, snorkels and life jackets. After spending some time, head over to Playa.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7ZqYQGG.jpg alt="The clear blue waters of Playa del Carmen"><figcaption><p>The clear blue waters of Playa del Carmen</p></figcaption></figure><p>Park your car somewhere (they have metered parking here) and head over to <strong>some place</strong>. The waitress had a good sense of humour and when we ordered two beers, she was like &ldquo;where&rsquo;s one for me?&rdquo;. We ordered a ton of food here. Their fresh drinks are also nice. I was surprised to find tamarind juice so refreshing.</p><p>Once your tummy is full, head over to the accomodation to check in, have some rest, and in the evening, explore the market of playa. You can have hot chocolate at <strong>au cocoa</strong> and then head over to the beer club if you&rsquo;re a fan. The guy over there knows his thing. You can actually sit by the bar and order drinks off the menu as well. Next, you might want to go to one of the nightclubs on fifth avenue. It was a bit too much for me so we skipped it. It has already been a long day and you might actually consider resting for the night.</p><h2 id=day-8-cozumel>Day 8: Cozumel</h2><p>The next day, wake up to have breakfast, get your covid tests done, and head over to the pier and buy tickets to cozumel. Winjet is 220 MXN per person, whereas Ultramar is 250 MXN plus taxes. The ferry is for 35 minutes. We don&rsquo;t recommend taking your car over there. Upon arriving, you can rent a car from one of the shops around San Miguel Church. There is definitely room for bargain, especially when it&rsquo;s mid day and they still haven&rsquo;t rented a car yet. We got a convertible Beetle. The dashboard said VW96 somewhere, so we&rsquo;re guessing it was made in 1996. This cost us 1000 MXN, plus taxes.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/T2MIZSe.jpg alt="That&amp;rsquo;s how our Beetle looked like."><figcaption><p>That&rsquo;s how our Beetle looked like.</p></figcaption></figure><p>By this time, you know we&rsquo;re a fan of cruising around. So we drove towards Punta Sur, the southernmost part of the island. You can have lunch at Raasta Cafe. It&rsquo;s located right near the entrance to Punta Sur. Make sure to try out their Coco Loco. It&rsquo;s a cocktail served in a coconut!</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/M5ptaSo.jpg alt="Make sure to try a Coco Loco."><figcaption><p>Make sure to try a Coco Loco.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Since you&rsquo;re already at the entrance, you can decide to go into the Punta Sur eco beach park, although we would recommend against it. We weren&rsquo;t able to see any marine life from playa Punta Sur. That being said, the view from the Faro Celarain lighthouse is breathtaking. You can see the blue ocean on one side, and the two lagoons on the other.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/glMjiQq.jpg alt="The view from the Faro Celarain lighthouse"><figcaption><p>The view from the Faro Celarain lighthouse</p></figcaption></figure><p>Next, continue cruising along the main road towards the north, and enjoy the views. Fuel up, return your car, and head over to the pier to watch the sunset. Take your tickets to the next ferry, and head back to Playa del Carmen. For dinner, you can go to Zenzi and enjoy the food. The restaurant closes at 1am, but you can sit by the beach if you want. Since this would be the last night of the trip, take some time and let the sea sink in.</p><h2 id=day-9-cancun>Day 9: Cancun</h2><p>Get up early, watch the sunrise again if you want, have breakfast, pack your bags and check out. Head over to Cancun and spend some time at your favourite restaurant, or drive by the hotel zone. It&rsquo;s surrounded by a lagoon on one side and the ocean on the other. You can stop by the beach to have a marquesita. It should now be time for your flight.
