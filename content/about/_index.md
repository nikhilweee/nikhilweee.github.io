Hi there! I'm Nikhil.

I'm just another brick in the wall who is currently working on helping AI models create fashion models. In a previous life, I was busy finding ways to make machines talk in a more natural manner. Apart from work, you can find me travelling, reading, or sometimes just chilling out at home as well ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .
