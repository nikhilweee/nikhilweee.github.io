# Things you'll need

Just the two of them will do.

- A **Server** : This is where your site contents will be stored. It's just an internet connected
  computer that'll stay awake 24x7 for your blog and will serve users with your blog as and when
  asked to so.

- A **Domain** : No one likes remembering IP addresses. You'll need this to give your blog a name.

# 1. Buy a server

You can buy a server online from your favourite provider. I suggest using
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=ad1b7e083b2e), where you can spin up a server
for just $5 per month. To get $10 in free credits, use
[this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=ad1b7e083b2e):

https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=ad1b7e083b2e

- [Sign up](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=ad1b7e083b2e) for an account and enter your credit
  card details or pay via PayPal.
- A `$5` droplet with an `Ubuntu` image at your nearest datacenter would be enough for a blog. No
  need for any `additional options` or `SSH Keys` for now.

# 2. Set up your server

Now that you've bought your own server, its time to set it up.
[Connect to your server via ssh](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-connect-to-your-droplet-with-ssh).
Consult these
[community tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/new-ubuntu-14-04-server-checklist)
for more details.

The server IP and root password can be found in your email when you set up your droplet.

```console
$ ssh root@<server IP>
```

# 3. Secure your server

These steps are not necessary, but _highly recommended_. I have skipped explaining them for brevity.
Consult the DigitalOcean
[community tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/new-ubuntu-14-04-server-checklist)
which explains all these steps in detail.

- **Create a new user and restrict it**. Why risk root access in case your server gets hacked?
- **Configure passwordless ssh**. So that only your computer can login to your server.
- **Disable root login**. You wouldn't want someone gaining root access to your server. Why not
  disable it in the first place?
- **Set up firewall** so that only specified ports remain open.

# 4. Set up your domain

I'll cover how to buy and point your domain to your server here.

- **Buy a domain**. You can use the [free ones](http://freenom.com/), or spend money for the popular
  ones. GoDaddy and NameCheap are reliable providers.
- **Use DigitalOcean nameservers**. This is optional, but lets you manage your server and domain
  from the same place. Edit your domain details to configure the nameservers to the following

```text
ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
```

- **Connect domain to droplet**. Go to `Networking > Domains` tab in DigitalOcean settings. Connect
  your domain with the droplet by entering your domain, say `nikhilweee.me`, selecting your droplet
  from the dropdown and hitting _Create Record_. Your domain should now point to your droplet IP.

# 5. Set up Ghost

Now that we've connected the domain and the droplet, it's time to set up your Ghost blog.

## Install `npm` and `node`

Ghost is written in javascript and needs node and npm to build and run on the server.

The first command installs node and npm, the second one upgrades npm, and the third one is required
for ubuntu, so that `node` is equivalent to `nodejs` in the terminal.

```console
$ apt-get install nodejs npm
$ npm install -g npm
$ ln -s "$(which nodejs)" /usr/bin/node
```

## Install Ghost

We'll download the latest version, extract and then install it to the recommended install directory.

We'll first install the tools `zip` and `wget` needed to download and extract the archive, then
create the recommended directory `/var/www/`, and then download and extract the latest version of
ghost. The following commands do just that.

```console
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install zip wget
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/
$ cd /var/www
$ sudo wget https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-latest.zip
$ sudo unzip -d ghost ghost-latest.zip
$ cd ghost/
$ sudo npm install --production
```

## Configure Ghost

Ghost stores your blog url in a `config.js` file. We'll first create the file using a default
template and then set the appropriate url. Open the config file by using the following commands, and
then under `config > production`, change the url to your new domain.

```console
$ sudo cp config.example.js config.js
$ sudo nano config.js
```

# 6. Set up Nginx

Nginx (read Engine-X) is the server software (that technically makes your droplet a server) that
we'll use to serve our blog. We won't use the ghost development server as that isn't a good
practice.

## Install nginx

It's our favourite `apt-get` command again.

```console
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
```

## Configure nginx

We'll create a configuration file for your site in the `sites-available` directory.

```console
$ cd /etc/nginx/
$ sudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost
```

Now edit the config file. The following snippet is the simplest configuration for a working ghost
blog. We are simply running your blog behind a proxy server. This way we get the robustness of nginx
along with a simple config. Paste this code into the editor. Replace `<domain.tld>` with your actual
domain.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <domain.tld>;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   Host      $http_host;
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:2368;
    }
}
```

## Enable your site

Simply symlink the file you just created to the `sites-enabled` directory and restart nginx.

```console
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ghost
$ sudo service nginx restart
```

At this stage, test your config

```console
$ cd /var/www/ghost
$ sudo npm start --production
```

You should be able to access your new ghost blog on your new domain. If not, there's been a mistake.
C'mon. Get working!

# 7. Set up autostart

Now that your blog is set up, we just finally need to ensure that the blog doesn't stop for any
reason and even autostarts on droplet restart. I'll do this using supervisor.

## Install supervisor

Again, `apt-get`.

```console
$ sudo apt-get install supervisor
```

## Configure your blog for supervisor

We'll again create a config file as we did for nginx.

```console
$ sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/ghost.conf
```

Now edit the file to create an autostart process so that your blog remains stable. `user` should be
an existing user on the system. Better to use a dedicated user as a safety measure as described in
`4. Secure your server` above.

```ini
[program:ghost]
command = node /var/www/ghost/index.js
directory = /var/www/ghost
user = ghost
autostart = true
autorestart = true
stdout_logfile = /var/log/supervisor/ghost.log
stderr_logfile = /var/log/supervisor/ghost_err.log
environment = NODE_ENV="production"
```

## Restart

```console
$ sudo supervisorctl reread
$ sudo supervisorctl update
$ sudo supervisorctl restart ghost
```

Now your blog is all set and would even withstand restarts. Cheers!
